# UNCONCEALED
A series of tools and Jupyter widgets for evaluating images,
to aid in forensic investigation or reporting. 
Unconcealed allows you to apply a series of transformations to 
a directory of images, allowing you to visualize evidence of 
image splicing or duplication.

## How it works
The primary feature of Unconcealed is a Jupyter widget that 
lets you select images, apply a mask, then access various
transformation and visualization tools via tabs. 

The widget also displays a record of all parameters used 
during an evaluation, allowing for reproducibility of the
work.

A specific feature captures and compares contours of image
elements (eg Western Blot bands), revealing similarities 
that may be the result of image duplication.

## Installation

### Dependencies 
Here are the other applications that Unconcealed uses to do 
its work. Most of these will be installed automatically, but 
you may want to manually install them ahead of time to 
configure them according to your other needs.
* opencv
* Pillow
* pdfimages (only if you need to use the image extraction feature)
* Jupyter, Ipywidgets (if you want to use the interactive widget module)
* numpy, pandas

### Getting started
The basic installation will need you to open your terminal and 
run:

`pip install unconcealed`

If you are using Python environments along with Jupyter, 
make sure that you install unconcealed into an environment 
accessible as a Jupyter kernel. You can read more about 
this from the [IPython documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#kernels-for-different-environments).


## Usage
1. Start up your Jupyter notebook
2. Note the directory/s where the images are located
    1. If you need to, you can use unconcealed.extract_from_pdf() to create a directory containing all images from a PDF, with the ability to filter based on image size.
3. Import the widget module:

```python 
from unconcealed import widgets
```

4. Prepare and load the widget:

```python 
load_evaluation_widget(IMAGE_DIRECTORY)
```

5. Navigate through the tabs to perform various transformations of the selected image. 
6. Use the first tab to change directory, and select which image to analyze.

## How to contribute
